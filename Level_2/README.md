# Level 2
In this level I been have asked to make a intervel merger 

Which should maintain a set of non-overlapping intervals and efficiently merge them when new intervals are added.

I have used sorted list for this que, and the operations in the code are of O(logn) and O(n) Time complexity with O(n) space complexity 

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) and O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
