# Level 0
In this I have been given a task to create a **Doubly linked** list with the following operations
- Node creation
- Insertion (head and tail)
- Traversal (forward and backward) and printing.
  
Uses cases:
  - Can be used in navigation systems for backward and forward transversal
  - In undo / redo operations
  - Implementing Tree data structures
  
Time complexity: O(n) and O(1)

Space Complexity: O(n)
