# Level 1
To design a stack that supports the following operations:
- push(x): Pushes element x onto the stack.
- pop(): Removes the top element of the stack.
- top(): Returns the top element without removing it.
- getMin(): Returns the smallest element in the stack.
- getMax(): Returns the largest element in the stack.
All the operation in the code use **O(n) space complexity** , **O(1) time complexity** except this printit operation which has O(n) time complexity
